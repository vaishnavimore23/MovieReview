# Java-React Application

This is a sample Java-React application that demonstrates how to integrate a Java backend with a React frontend.Data base here used is - MongoDB

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Code editor for JavaScript/React, such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Backend (Java)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>


Backend (Java)
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Import the backend project into your IDE and ensure all dependencies are resolved.

Run the Java application. The backend server should start running on http://localhost:8080.

Frontend (React)
Open a new terminal window/tab.

Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend


npm install
npm start


The React application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the React application.
Use the application to interact with the backend server and perform various tasks.
